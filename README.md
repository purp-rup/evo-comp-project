# TSP Art Generator

## Highlights
- **Automated Image Processing**: Converts any input image into a set of points for TSP tour generation.  
- **Voronoi Stippling**: Uses a weighted voronoi stippling algorithm to extract points from images.  
- **Evolutionary Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose from various evolutionary algorithms to optimize tour quality.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable settings for number of cities and algorithm-specific parameters to control output fidelity.  
- **Live Visualization**: Animated display showing the TSP tour generation process in real-time.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI built with Swing for easy algorithm selection and parameter configuration.  

## Overview
The TSP Art Generator is a Java application that creates art using Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) tours. Unlike traditional TSP art implementations that require predetermined city lists, this tool automates the entire process by accepting any image as input.

## Design
This application was developed using Java 21, leveraging the Chips-n-Salsa library for evolutionary algorithm implementations. The graphical user interface is built using Swing, providing an accessible platform for algorithm selection, parameter configuration, and tour visualization.
